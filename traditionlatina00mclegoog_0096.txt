ceding this (p. 430, 29 K) he seeum to give slight evidence ο1 stress: Accen-
tus est acutus vel gravis vel inflexa elatio orationis vocisve intentio vel
inclinatio acuto aut inflexo sono regens verba. Nam ut nulla vox sine
vocali est, ita sine¹ accentu nulla est; et est accentus, ut quidam recte
putaverunt, velut animaveris. The use oi ‘elatio’ and ‘intentio' in the
same sentence shows that he hesitates as to which theory to accept.

When we come to Servius, born perhaps before 360, we find a new and
more healthy tradition. It is true that he gives the orthodox derivation
ο1 the word ‘accentus' and mentions ‘tonus’ and ‘tenor' as synonymous
(c. in Don. p. 426, 7 K). But this he does lor pedagogical purposes, as
also in de fin. p. 451, 9 K: Medias syllabas tribus modis cognoscimus,
positione et diphthongis et accentu. Sed de positione et diphthongis ι
supra tractavimus. Accentus autem est quasi adcantus dictus, quod ad
cantilenam vocis nos facit agnoscere syllabas. He then explains what
he means by ‘cantilena vocis': Qui vocis accentus duo sunt ad ea quae
tractamus necessarii, correptus et productus. Correptus est, quotiens
sine ulla mora vocis medias syllabas enuntiamus, ut moenia nsua. Pro·
ductus est, quotiens medias syllabas eum aliqua mora vocis exprimimus,
ut sottum nutura He could not suddenly break away from the tenna ol
the musical theory, lor this was the traditional nomenclatura.

In his commutarim in Dos. p. 426, 16 K, there is certain evidence oi
stress accent: Accentus in ea syllaba est, quae plus sonat. Quam rem
deprehendimus, si fingamus nos aliquem longe positum clamare. Inveni-
musenim naturali ratione illam syllabam plus sosrnre, qaae retinet accentum,
atque usque eodem nisum vocis ascendere. Fora similar view, ci.

It has been suggested that those grammarians who speak in terms of
stress accent lived ata time when the Latin accent had become stressed
and that they gave laws for the accentuation ol their own time which were
not applicable to the classical period.² Ι1 this is true, it isa curious fact
that all those who wrote upon this subject in the time ο1 Servius or later
did not state the case as he did. The passages where the laws oi accentu-
ation are given, in which no mention is made ο1 the loud or strong sound
(plus sonat), are the following:³
