THE TRADITION OF THE LATIN ACCENT

Ι. sources

In this investigation into the tradition oi the Latin accent, I shall attempt
to present the sources in chronological order, so far asthis can be determined.
As a outa fundamentum the esabniment of uns ordene. Schoeflp. 4)
line 21: “Quare ut Cratetem Romanos ad studia grammatica compulisse
scimus, ita Tyrannionem eis hanc eorum partem aperuisse crediderim, illum
autem ‘oratoris' Ciceroniani locum primum omnium de accentu latino
testimonium esse: id quod non modo ad doctrinae historiam, sed ad ipsam
doctrinam pernoscendam aliquid valere videbimus.'’

Orator XVIII, 58. Ipsa enim natura, quasi modularetur hominum ora- cronos
tionem, in omni verbo posuit acutam vocem nec una plus neca postrema ΜΗ·
syllaba citra tertiam (B. C. 46). ’

Philologists have established the fact that this was not only not a law oi
nature, but that it was not true ior Greek or Latin in the pre-historic
period oi the languages, and Iam inclined to think it was not a law which
governed the accentuation oi Latin in the historic period. Cf. Giles, 5267:
“Ibe changes in the Greek accent seem to have been brought about by the
development oi a secondary accent which, in words whose last syllable was
long, never receded iarther from the end oi the word than the penultimate,
and in no case iarther than the third syllable . . . . Iithis new accent
chanced to agree in position with the old acoent inherited from the Indo·
Germanic period, no change took place. If the old acuent, which,'being
absolutely free, could stand on any cynoth, was nearer the end oi the word

’ than this new secondary accent, the old acoent might remain or the new
acoent might take its place. '' But it is true that in the historic period oi
the Greek language the acoent never receded ‘a postrema syllaba citra
tertiam' And, as it was true in Greek, why should not Cicero be pre-
vailed upon to think that it was true in Latin?

But it was not true in Latin; ci. Giles, §272: “In the changes which
latin accent has undergone since abandoning the original Indo-Germanic
system oi accentuation, two stages are observable. (a) The first change,

..... was to a system in which the first syllable oi the word bore
in all oases a stress accent. In Latin this system had given way before
the historical era to (b) the system which continued to prevail throughout
