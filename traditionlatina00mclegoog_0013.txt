the classical period.'' He then gives the three-syllable law as the system
which prevailed throughout this period.

The statement oi Cicero, then ..... necapostrema syllaba citra
tertiam, is not true ior the pre-historic period. In this Giles and scholars
in general agree. Nor is it true for the historic period, since, according
to FitzHugh’s Tripodic Theory, the first syllable ol every Latin word re·
ceives a poweriul stress. By this theory he explains such phenomena as
the so-called vowgl-weakening, while “hellenizing pragmatism inventa its
theory oi the ‘pre-historic initial accent,' because it had to explain ‘vowel-
weakening’ under the ‘historioal’ accent. ’'—The Literary Saturnian, Part
ΙΙ, p. 102.

And Cicero was one oi these hellenizing pragmatists. The letter ad
Atticum XII, 6 implies that some new acoentual theory ‘tenuis empta’ was
under consideration, and that Cicero was heartily in favor oi it. This
theory was none other than that introduced into Rome by the Greek ι
grammarian, Tyrannio Amisemus. In the part of this letter which refers
to Tyrannio and the book περὶ προσῳδιων, there isa sort oi mysterious
tone. But when we read between the lines, as it were, we are driven
to the conclusion that this new theory was the accentual theory ol the
Greeks, and that Cicero and Atticus were making an agreement to accept
it and thrust it upon the Romans ii they could.

Some nomenclatore was necessary by which to erpound this new theory,
and this was obtained by translating into Latin the terms which the Greeks
applied to their own musical accent. Cicero rendered ὀξέα eporedia,
high or sharp musical tone, by acuto uox3 cf. Corssen, 11, 798. And in a
· passage oi the De Oratore,¹ where he is discussing the musical tones by
which the orator may make his speech agreeable to the ear, may we not
conclude that he is tacitly giving instruction and proposing terms suitable
lor applying this Greek accentual theory, with which he was so much de-
lighted, to the Romans? ’

To state briefly, then, the influenoe oi Cicero upon our accentual tradition,
the evidence seems to show that, in this critical initial period, we have the
germ, so to speak, oi an accentual fiction that has affected the tradition
lrom this day to our own. See FitzHugh, L. S, pp. 38-48.
