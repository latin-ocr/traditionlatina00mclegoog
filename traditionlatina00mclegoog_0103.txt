fuerit, tunc tertia a fine habebit accentum3 et tamen ecce corruptam in·

cogatur habere accentum, non naturaliter, sed causa istamm . . . .

The accentuation Maudne Musaue etc. given here does not seem -to be
correct. Ol the passages where this matter is discussed, three, as indicated

by examples used, are in accord with this one: Servius c. in Don. p. 427, ’

6Κ; ad Aen. I, 116; ad Aen. X, 668. The rule is always stated as it ie·
here, but examples like M usdm are not given. cl. Varro p. 218, 8 G-S=
Varro apud Martianum Cap. III p. 67, 25 Eyss. (Iatitimque,stimu16ve);
, Diomedes p. 433, 19 Κ (liminaque laurtisque dei, Hyrcanisve ArabIsve
parant, calathisve Minervae, hominesne leraene); Priscianus partit. I,
26 p. 466, 1 K (vitrimque, subiectisve, tantone); Codex Bernensis 123:
Anecd. Helvet. p. XXXIII H. (doctosque etc). In Priscianus V, 63 p.
181, 16 H, the acoent ol the lamminas, utruque and pleraque, is given on
the analogy of the masculine and the neuter. Schoell¹ thinks that Priscian
meant that this was a later analogical development, but it is evident lrom
the illustrations used throughout his work that it was a grammar ol clas·
sical Iatin,and therefore he must have considered this analogy as operativa
in classioal times.

Pompeius' systematic treatment of accentuation is now completed, and
ο1 the several remarks bearing on the subject scattered here and there
throughout his work little discussion is necessary.

let us look at his precept with regard to culos, nostros, Arpinas, etc.
(p. 205, ³ K). He enjoins the exclusive use of the original unsyncopated
forms, sumtis ete( . . . . ut tollas ambiguitatem obicientis hoc, dic
catab: nemo enim dicit ruiana per rerum naturam non potest herl).
And thereby he admits that some say cuias, and perrarum notmom posse
fieri. “Ergo ad illud potius debes consentire et illudio usu habere, de
quo nemo dubitat. Et illud lectum est et illud.'' The only passage which

is in any way in accord with this one is Servius [Sergius] c. in Don. p. .

435, 31 K, where the pronunciation of such words as perispomena is brand·
ed as wrong( . . . . Plerique accentum in ultima syllaba ponunt,
quando dIcimus cuiun sed prave). The words are given as perispomena
in all the other passages. See Schoell XCVII ‘¹¹ where the teslt'monio are
collected and cl. also p. 60, especially adn. 2.

Pompeius p. 255, 21 K, may be relerred to the priuciple lor the accentua-
tion ol compound words (p. 1³0, 18 Κ) already discussed under the rules;
the principle ol p. 279, 37 Κ, hasbeen discussed under the exceptions.
