The fact that the gramman'ans oi this later time used illustrations taken
from classical Latin authors is even more significant.

Important in their bearing upon the nature oi the Latin acuent are
passages ο1 two· Greek writers, Athenaeus and Olympiodorus. All that we
know oi the life ot the former is that he was born at Naucratis, in Egypt,
under Marcus Aurelius; the latter was a neo-Platonist ol the later fifth
or sixth century.

‚ Athenaeus Deipnos. X p. 425 a.

Kal παρὰ Ῥωμαύοις δὲ ol εὐγενέστατοι τῶν παίδων τὴν λειτουργίαν ταύτην
ἐκτελοῦσιν ἑν τοῖς δημοτελέσι τῶν θυσιῶν πάντα τοός Αἰολεῖς μιμούμενοι ὥς καὶ
κατὰ πούς τόνους τῆς φωνῆς.

Casaubon’s note upon this passage is as follows: Verissimum est quod
’ scribit aliquanto post Athenaeus: Romanos & in moribus institutisque
multis, & κατὰ τούς τόνους τῆς φωνῆς, Aeoles potissimum ex omnibus
Graecis esse imitatos. Utriusque linguae periti fatebuntur ita esse: ac
memini Dionysium Halieamasseum, 8ι Priscianum aliquot locis disertim
huius uos admonere.

Aeolic Greek was barytone.

Would this indicate that the Romans had no circumflex acuent? The
meaning oi, κόμπος is not clear. The translation ‘pride,' ‘haughtiness,'²
generally given ior this passage, does not seem to suit it. Can it be equiv-
alent to the Latin tripudic stress? The definition ο1 the word, given in
Duncan, lexicon Graecum ol Tobias Damm, lollows: κόμπος, sonus qui

¹ I believe that this was the work oi Priscian lor three reasons: 1. Priscian nowhere
in the works generally ascribed to him treats accentuation systematioally and categorically,
as he treats other subjects ο1 grammar. 2. Priscian, XVII, 40 p. 133, l Η, mentions
his book on accentuation: . . . . de quibus in libro, qui est de accentibus, latius
tractavimus. 3. Alcuin in certain oi bis remarks upon accent reflects both Priscian
and Ps-Priscian. Cl. Alcuin p. 2081 Ρ.; 2086 Ρ.; 2099 Ρ.; 2104 Ρ.; 2159 Ρ.; 2140 P.
Little importante coulgl be attached to the last unless it were true that Priscian was ex-
tensively studied in the Middle Ages. ’
