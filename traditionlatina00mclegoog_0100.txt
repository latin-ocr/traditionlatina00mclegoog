There is practioal unanimity in these passages so that we may have no
doubt as to the teaching of the grammarians in this matter. However,
the two passages of Martianus Capella should be noticed, ior the last
seems to contradict the first. Mart. Cap. ΠΙ p. 65, 22 Eyss.: Omnis igitur
vox Latina simplex sive composita habet unum sonum aut acutum aut
circumflexum. Duos autem acutos aut inflexos habere numquam potest,
gravis vero saepe. III p. 68, 15 Eyss.: Sciendum etiam uni vocabulo
accedere omnes tres accentus posse ut est Argiletum. Schoell thinks
that we have here a reference to Varro's ‘media.'¹

Before leaving the rules, the acoentuation of Greek loan-words should
be briefly noticed. The principle generally held is that the Greek words iu
a Latin author which retained their Greek form and declension retained
also· the Greek ac'oent, while those Greek words which becaun naturalized
at Rome were adapted to the Latin accentuation-and deciension.² Pom-
peius does not discuss this, but the principle is amply substantiated by
numerous passages of the grammarians, notably [Sergiusl Servius, and
works that have corne down to us under the name of Probus. The pas·
sages are collected by Schoell in his last chapter, p. 201-215.

111. Tha Α pparent Exceptions to tlte Rulea

Pompeius p. 130, 28 K: Diximus regulas accentuum. Modo videamus,
quae sunt res quae corrumpunt regulas. Tres sunt tantum, distincti0,
discretio, pronuntiatio; . . . . Quoniam dinmus, ‘distinctio cor-
rumpit regulas,’ videamus quo mod0. Si male distinguas, potest
errare puer et dicere ‘interea loci’ et facere inde duas partes orationis,
cum debeas subter facere hyphen. Quid sit autem hyphen, dicemus

postea (see p. 132, 7 K). Ergo debes hyphen deorsum facere et conectere
utramque. Si dicas ‘viridique in litore conspicitur sus,' potest de istis⁴
duabus unam facere. Ergo distinctio corrumpit istas regulas. The
δέκα προσῳδίαι of Aristophanes of Byzantium are enumerated by Pom· ι
peius p. 132, 1 K ff. ln addition to the markings for the acute, the grave,
and the circumflex, and the hyphen and the diastole here mentioned under
the heading of ‘distinctim’ we have the long and the short, diacritioal

marks used inancient times, as now, to show the ‘longitudo' of ‘the syl·
lable; the apostrophe; and the breathings to indicate the ‘crassitudo' or
‘latitudo'. These markings which are given among the σημεῖα 01 Aris·

¹ See Schoell p. 46. Cf. the discussion ol the ‘media prosodia’ in Ahlberg p. 6 ff.
² See Lindsay p. 155.
