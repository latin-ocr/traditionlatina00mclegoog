Those who hold that the Latin accent was one 111 which stress predomi-

· nates base their conclusions 011 the phenomena of the language itself and

of the languages derived from it. The promoters of the 1111161061 theory,
on the other hand, claim the statements of the grammarians as their
authority. It hasbeen proved that our theory 01 Indo-European arcent
is false in its origin, and that the commonly accepted theory of the Latin
accent 16 the result of an attempt in classioal times to foist upon the Ro-
mans the Greek musical accent.¹ Let us now examine in detail the state-
ment 01 all the ancient writers.

Cicero, Or. XVIII, 58 has been discussed above. For Varro, see Fitz·
Hugh, L. S., pp. 3948. Α remark of Gellius (N. A. XIII, 6, 1) seems to
give evidence 111 favor of the 611666 theory. See this passage above.

Marius Victorinus (fl. 324-361) was the first to discuss the Latin acoent
systematically. The conclusion reached from a study of his Ars Gram-
matica (p. 192, 15 Κ 11.) 16 that he was influenced by the Ciceronian and
Varronian tradition and therefore regarded the Latin accent as musical.

Α similar impression is gained from a study of Aelius Donatus p. 371,
2 Κ ff. (about the middle of the fourth century); from Diomedes p. 431,
1 K 11. (second half 01 the fourth century), though in the passage pre-
